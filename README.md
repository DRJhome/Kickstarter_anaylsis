# Kickstarter_anaylsis
## Project Scope
 This project was to breakdown the results of all the kickstart programs to see where there was success and failures were. This information will allow the teams to set themselves up to succeed in the kickstart programs they are creating.
 
## Analysis
The first area I looked at is does the time of year affect the success rate. The data clearly shows that or Theater kickstarts, May was the best month to launch closely followed by June. After June the success rate went down on a sharp slope as you can see below.

## Summary
After looking at the numbers and the chart I can see that you should avoid starting any kickstart programs from October – March, and make sure you don’t start anything in December. December is by far the least successful month. Another big factor is the Goal set for the kickstart. When you look at both line charts you see that any goal under $10,000 is highly successful and drops off till you get around the $35,000 - $45,000 dollar goal. Putting the two charts together will give you the vision to plan and create goals that would be the most successful while avoiding setting yourself up for failure.
